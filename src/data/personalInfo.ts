    // Extended Bio for About page
    bio: `I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 5 years of experience building web applications that solve real-world problems. My journey in tech started when I built my first website at 15, and I haven't stopped learning since.

I specialize in React, Next.js, Node.js, and cloud technologies. I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and creating user experiences that are both beautiful and functional.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new hiking trails, reading tech blogs, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in continuous learning and staying curious about emerging technologies.`,
